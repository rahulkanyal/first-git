this is a testing repository to test various features of command line of linux in git hub


The things that I learned till now:-

1. make a new folder for carriying out fun stuff to github
2. "git init" within that folder for initialising various things required for git
3. make a new file or add other for monitoring and for maintaining a databases of changes(let it be file_name)
4. git add file_name 
5. commit that i.e approve of the changes to that file by git commit -m "message about the changes goes here"
6. connect yourself with the remote repository  git remote add "temp-local-name(origin preferred for original)" https://github.com/user_name/repo_name.git
7. finally push all the files to the repo git push -u "temp-local-name" "name of branch==master"
